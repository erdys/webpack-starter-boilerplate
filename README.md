# Webpack - starter boilerplate

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
```

The `dev` command will start a dev server and watch for code changes in JS and SCSS files. Hot reloading is enabled, so that any change will be visible in your browser as you type.

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production usage, run the `build` command and everything packed together into the `public` directory.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Environment Configuration

The `.env.sample` file should contain all the variables that your application needs.
